  <h5>Super Bright Display</h5><br>
  <p>Your world just got a whole lot brighter. The G7 ThinQ packs additional white pixels into the screen for stunning picture clarity and brightnessâ€”while maximizing battery efficiency.</p><br>
  <h5>Design</h5><br>
  <p>LG has announced the technical details of the LG G7 ThinQ display. Among other things, LG confirms that an IPS panel will be used. It measures 6.1 inches diagonally and has a resolution of 3,120 x 1,440 pixels. This results in an aspect ratio of 19.5:9.
    The LG G7 should also have a particularly bright display, the brightest in the smartphone market, according to the manufacturer. LG speaks of the panel reaching a brightness of 1,000 nits. This should ensure good legibility even in daylight. Nevertheless,
    the display will consume up to 30 percent less energy than previous IPS panels. In addition, LG wants to impress with its color representation. The LG G7's display supports the DCI-P3 standard and covers 100 percent of it. Users can adjust the color
    representation to their taste, either with several preset profiles or by setting the individual color controls according to their own wishes.</p><br>
